\subsection*{Part A}

Question: How did you upload the ESOF 322 files into your Github account? \\\\
Solution: I began by navigating to the esof-322 directory on my computer. I then created a local repository on my computer using the "git init" command. 
I then staged all the subdirectories in esof-322 for a commit. Next, I commited those files with the commit message "initial commit".
Then, on my GitHub account, I created a repository called esof-322.
Finally, I set up the online repository as the remote for my local respository and pushed my initial commit.
